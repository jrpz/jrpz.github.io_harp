# A Blast From The Not So Distant Past

Late 2013 or early 2014 (I can't exactly remember) we decided to move the [brlrl](http://brlrl.com) site, blog and portfolio over from a self-hosted Wordpress instance to the new Squarespace 6 platform.  Seems weird right, a custom web shop using a tool like Squarespace to publish our own site?  It is.  But, that's not what this article is about.

With bringing the new site live the old site, along with all it's little nuggets of goodness, was put to bed.

One such nugget was the homepage hero unit.  We wanted to produce something special here, so naturally we went with a barrel roll.  Get it?

At this point in my dev career I had not done very much animation, though I had always wanted to.  Originally I attempted to create the barrel rolling hero with some JavaScript and CSS animation, but the outcome was choppy and sluggish at times.  

Eventually I turned to [Raphael JS](http://raphaeljs.com/).  Now I'm not sure why I originally chose Raphael JS and I don't think I would choose it again.  But I did and here's a pen of the barrel rolling hero.

We also wanted to use animation to represent certain aspects of fighter jet piloting.  We looked at old jet manuals and cockpit pictures and liked the look of horizon instruments.  Here's what we came up with for portfolio buttons.

Unfortunately I have not worked on many animations since this project.  Hoping that changes soon.
